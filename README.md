This project aims to study and analyse the importance of the discretization applied in density estimation algorithms.
So, here we are doing a comparation between 5 (five) differents methods:
- Linspace
- CDFm
- PDFm
- iPDF1
- iPDF2

These methods are explained in details in the paper called "Study of the Discretization Process applied to Continuous Random Variables in the Density Estimation Context" published on the 3rd International Symposium on Instrumentation Systems, Circuits and Transducers in 2018.


# Abstract
Lately, with the emergence of large data-generating experiments, there is a growing demand to optimize the algorithms responsible for interpreting this volume of information so that it uses as little data as possible to perform the desired operation. This work permeates this context, proposing alternatives in one of the most elementary choices in estimation/classification algorithms: discretization of a given variable. This paper proposes to evaluate the characteristics of different discretization methods applied to probability density function estimation considering the trade-off between performance and simplicity, as well as susceptibility to outliers. In addition, this work analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of each method and indicates possible ways to extend the knowledge about the addressed subject.
